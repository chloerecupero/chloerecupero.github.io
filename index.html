    <h1>MY LIFE</h1>
    <div class="bodytext">
    <p> Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Chloe. I am currently a freshman at the University of Washington studying computer science with a concentration in data science and minoring in French. I'm a Seattle native and have lived here most my life. I spent a few years living abroad in Luxembourg where I travelled a lot and practice French. My family moved back to Seattle after a few years. I am an avid runner and love to be outside in the PNW (hiking, skiing etc.). I work at Oiselle a women's owned running store in University Village and plan to work at Coding for Kids this summer running introduction to programming one week camps! I love Din Tai Fung and also eating Italian food!</p>

     <p> I'm super close to my family so its nice to be close at school and still have the opportunitiy to visit them! I have a younger brother Vince who is just 2 years younger than me. My two parents are the best.</p>
    <p>One of the things that I touched on earlier that I love most about life is adventure. I love the opportunity to be sponteanous and take risks. You only have one life so I believe you should make the best of it. Some of the ways that I do this is to try to be outside as much as possible. In the summers I try to get out to the mountains once a week to go on a 5-9 mile hike. I love taking advantage of nature and feel especially lucky to be in the PNW. One of my more impressive adventures was during the Summer of 2022, I went to Alaska for a month to backpack on a course through the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). This was the most amazing experiences of my life and solidified my love for the outdoors. I learned leadership skills, risk managemnet and environmental practicum. It was overall a great experience! </p>
